### What is Cub3D ?

---

Cub3D is a team project at 1337) that asks us to create a "3D" game engine with [miniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux). This project is inspired by the world-famous 90's game [Wolfenstein 3D](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), which was the first [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter#:~:text=First%2Dperson%20shooter%20(FPS),in%20a%20three%2Ddimensional%20space.) ever. The objective of this project is to deep dive into the mathematical concepts behind the [ray-casting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) such as calculating distances, height, sprite locations and field of view to create a projection using primarily [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry).

#### Skills needed :

---

- Rigor.
- Imperative programming.
- Graphics.
- Algorithms & AI.

---

#### Raycasting :

Raycasting is a rendering technique ti create a 3D perspective in a 2D map (Grid)
- it is considered one of the most basic graphics-rendering algorithms. Ray casting 
makes use of the same geometric algorithm as ray tracing.

---

#### Java-Script version of our raycaster engine :

---

A simple game to study raycasting using JavaScript and p5.js library.

Raycasting Programming with JavaScript This project is the first part of Professor Gustavo Pezzi's 
(Pikuma) course, Raycasting Programming with C. Using the p5.js library to facilitate the design of 
geometric shapes and the game loop, we can focus on the raycasting algorithm. The objective of 
this project was to deep into the mathematical concepts behind the raycasting algorithm used 
in the game Wolfenstein (1992), such as calculations of distances, height of walls, character and field of view using trigonometry.
