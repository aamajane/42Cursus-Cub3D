### What is Cub3D ?

---

Cub3D is a team project at 1337) that asks us to create a "3D" game engine with [miniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux). This project is inspired by the world-famous 90's game [Wolfenstein 3D](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D), which was the first [FPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter#:~:text=First%2Dperson%20shooter%20(FPS),in%20a%20three%2Ddimensional%20space.) ever. The objective of this project is to deep dive into the mathematical concepts behind the [ray-casting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) such as calculating distances, height, sprite locations and field of view to create a projection using primarily [trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry).

#### Skills needed :

---

- Rigor.
- Imperative programming.
- Graphics.
- Algorithms & AI.

---

#### Raycasting :

Raycasting is a rendering technique ti create a 3D perspective in a 2D map (Grid)
- it is considered one of the most basic graphics-rendering algorithms. Ray casting 
makes use of the same geometric algorithm as ray tracing.
